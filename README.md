  *A program that computes a simple topographic map (a text file where numbers represent the height of a given point)  and represents it in **a wireframe isometric projection**. The goal is to discover **the basics of graphic programming** and to use **miniLibX graphic** library*
  
  *The program takes the text file as entry, parses it, transforms the numbers into x,y,z coordinates, then calculates the isometrical representation associated with it.*
  
  *The **miniLibX** only allows you to open a window and change the color of pixels inside it. To draw lines I used an integer based Bresenham algorithm.*
  
  *To use the program, clone the repo, then use make command to compile, then enter "./fdf nameofthetestmap.txt"*
  *The program should work for MacOS and Linux*
